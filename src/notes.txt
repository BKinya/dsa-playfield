Algorithms
-> its a way / steps taken to solve a problem.
-> should not be based on a computer or programming language.
-> describe a finite, deterministic, and effective problem-solving method suitable for implementation as a computer program

Examples: Write an algorithm to find the GCD of two non negative numbers p and q
